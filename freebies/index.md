## Anything you'd like?

If you see anything here that you'd like to have, let me know, it's all free. I'd rather give it to friends than to charity. Does that make me a bad person?

> Some of these items might be gently used and not in perfect shape or potentially missing a part/piece/cord/etc. If you're interested in having me do an inventory, just let me know and I'll check for you.

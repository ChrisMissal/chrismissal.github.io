I just watched a very short video by Jane McGonigal and I was actually opposed to many of the things she said. I was surprised, I normally love video games; I think video games are just fine. In fact, I have played video games for a very large portion of my life. While she argues that they're not a waste of time (as was a driving force for her talk here), I have a better idea: Get out and experience life as it actually exists. I still have maps of video games in my head after not playing them for over 10 years. In hindsight, I would much rather have maps of the Grand Canyon, Yellowstone, or even Bourbon Street in my head. These are places where my impact can make a difference, I can interact and have fun, or help others. Jane gives very good examples, but I think they're very narrow opinions on what's important.

Before you read on, I suggest you watch/listen to the summary here:

<a title="When we are on our deathbeds, will we regret the hours we spent playing games?" href="http://kotaku.com/5919656/when-we-are-on-our-deathbeds-will-we-regret-the-hours-we-spent-playing-games" target="_blank">http://kotaku.com/5919656/when-we-are-on-our-deathbeds-will-we-regret-the-hours-we-spent-playing-games</a>

Under the assumption you listened, here are her five points that she received from hospice workers. You know her take on them by now since you listened to the video.
<ol>
	<li>I wish I hadn't worked so hard.</li>
	<li>I wish I had stayed in touch with my friends.</li>
	<li>I wish I had let myself be happier.</li>
	<li>I wish I'd had the courage to express my true self.</li>
	<li>I wish I'd lived a life true to my dreams, instead of what others expected of me.</li>
</ol>
I feel like all of these statements are just fine as they're spoken by the dying. I feel that when taken into a video game context, they're misconstrued. I'm going to give you my rebuttal on Jane's interpretation:
<ol>
	<li>You can work hard and still have fun - find a job that is fun and get good at it. You don't have to immerse yourself in things that are make-believe.</li>
	<li>You can stay in touch with family and friends without playing games. This is possible without competetive behavior and relies more on the actual relationship than gamesmanship. Not everybody is at their best when competing.</li>
	<li>Games can make you happier, no doubt. However, many games are going online or online only. So many trolls and jerks exist in the online world. Why would one want to surround themselves with these types of people? I'd rather surround myself with those that I choose, not random MMO strangers that just want to grief me. If you still want to play games with friends, game up in somebody's house or apartment, you'll be closer friends in the long run because of it.</li>
	<li>A way to express my true self. Sure, use made up characters to express your true self. You're actually choosing a character to portray yourself in the way you want to be. You're creating a false world for yourself. If your true self is something unrealistic, I'd say you have a tenuous grasp on reality (unless you're a really young kid). It's fine to want to be a hero in the sense that some firefighters are heroes, but to be a hero in the sense that you can fly or shoot lasers out of your eyes, grow up.</li>
	<li>Do what you want! Make art. Build something spectacular. Give back to your community. Express your ideas. These can all contradict the fallacies I've described above. That's why Jane left a question mark. This is important and those other four reasons are just tiny bits of this. You have one life to live and you need to make it your own. Don't hurt people, don't do wrong, just be the best human being you can and help others to be the best they can.</li>
</ol>
I can't be too far off, can I?

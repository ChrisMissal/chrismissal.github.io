I'm <strong>finally </strong>building a Ruby application using <a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com">Sinatra</a>! It's only going to be a few pages in size, but hopefully I'll get some decent practice with Ruby, Haml and ActiveRecord. The end goal of this little endeavor is to be able to throw away the code and know how to recreate something similar (and better) than this first attempt.

I have a tiny site I'm planning on building by the end of the year with Ruby on Rails. Ideally, this first throw away application will give me the smarts to build something real.

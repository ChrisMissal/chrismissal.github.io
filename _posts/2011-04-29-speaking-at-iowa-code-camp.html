I'm speaking at <a title="Iowa Code Camp Spring 2011" href="http://iowacodecamp.com/">Iowa Code Camp</a>Â <strong>April 30th</strong> on unit testing for those who haven't unit tested before. I will post my code and my slides some time next week, but if you're in the area and you haven't ever written a unit test (I know you're out there!), come to my presentation with a quiver of questions.

It's at <strong>Kirkwood Community College</strong> in <strong>Cedar Rapids, IA</strong>, Iowa Hall Room D at <strong>10:30am</strong>.

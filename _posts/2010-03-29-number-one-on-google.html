So this site is finally number one on Google searches for "chris missal". I wasn't actively trying to get the number one spot with this domain, but I was kind of surprised that it took as long as it did. All my other sites are still ranking very high, which is good. So now when I forget which web sites I run and maintain, I can just do a search to find the most important one at the top. ;)

Also, my book reading is going alright, but not great. I'm halfway through another tech book that I'll be reviewing here when I'm finished and the other week I completed my first fiction book in about 12 years.

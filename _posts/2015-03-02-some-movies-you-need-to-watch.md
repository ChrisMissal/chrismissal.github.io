So I decided to watch another movie in my Netflix list (formerly "My Queue", I still can't not call it that), and decided I should share a little story behind a tweet of mine:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever seen a Sam Rockwell movie I didn&#39;t love.</p>&mdash; Chris Missal (@ChrisMissal) <a href="https://twitter.com/ChrisMissal/status/572620739754397696">March 3, 2015</a></blockquote>

I had only seen one of Sam Rockwell's movies until my brother recommended Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. Before that, it was Confessions of a Dangerous Mind. After digging in some more, I realize there are loads of other movies he's done that I should see, but I'm only going to list the ones I've seen and recommend. They're all amazing and if you haven't seen some of them, go watch them.

- Confessions of a Dangerous Mind
- Hitchhiker's Guid to the Galaxy
- Matchstick Men
- Moon
- The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford 
- Seven Psychopaths
- Better Living Through Chemistry

Now for a couple that I haven't seen, but need to see:

- The Green Mile
- Choke
- A Midsummer Night's Dream

And why not throw a bad one in there (nobody's perfect):

- Cowboys and Aliens

What are some other movies I should see?

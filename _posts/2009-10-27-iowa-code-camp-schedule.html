The <a href="http://iowacodecamp.com">Iowa Code Camp</a> schedule of sessions has been posted for the fall 2009 event in West Des Moines, Iowa. My session entitled <strong>"How to do Virtually Anything with jQuery"</strong> will be at 2:15pm (subject to change).

Here's the abstract:
<blockquote>When it comes to web site interactivity, jQuery is king. I've never run into a problem I haven't been able to solve... yet! There's so much you can do with it and many clever plug-ins are created all the time. This isn't an intro course, you'll want to know how to use jQuery to get something out of this, I'm going to go over some complex examples that will hopefully ignite your brain when it comes to solving problems that occur within a dynamic web interface.</blockquote>

I've been working on a project for a long time and it's gone through many, many iterations and even one full rewrite. Normally, I would never approach a project like this, but there is no client on the other side. This is just a project that I'm doing for fun and for learning. If it ever goes live, it's  for a domain name that I bought over a year ago.

The best part of this is that I can delete code and pull in new frameworks as I please. I'm hosting it on <a href="http://github.com">Github</a> (so as to learn Git more), using <a href="http://asp.net/mvc">ASP.NET MVC</a> (which I know and love), taking advantage of the HTML control I'm given with the <a href="http://sparkviewengine.com">SparkViewEngine</a> (because I like looking at pretty view files) and pulling in <a href="http://automapper.codeplex.com/">AutoMapper</a> (<a href="http://www.lostechies.com/blogs/jimmy_bogard/default.aspx">Jimmy</a> rocks!) and eventually <a href="http://nhforge.org">NHibernate</a> (later, because I want my domain to rule, not the database).

There's much more I'm using and learning in this project, those are just the first ones that come to mind.

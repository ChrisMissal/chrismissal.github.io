So I've been working at Headspring for just over a year and still very happy with my decision to move to from Iowa to Texas for this job. Even if we weren't doing a tremendous job, and growing at a great pace, I'd still be happy. The rapid growth is bringing on much exciting news:
<ul>
	<li><span style="line-height:13px;">We are <a title="Headspring expands to Houston" href="http://www.bizjournals.com/houston/blog/nuts-and-bolts/2013/01/austin-tech-company-headspring-to-open.html">expanding to Houston!</a> - When I started, we had a small office (now we have 4x the space) as well as an office opening in Houston very soon.</span></li>
	<li><a title="Headspring is Hiring" href="http://www.headspring.com/careers">We are hiring</a> like crazy! - Last time I counted, we have had 16 new hires since me in Feb 2012. I can't wait to count in another 11 months.</li>
	<li>We have created <a title="Headspring Mobile" href="http://www.headspringmobile.com/">Headspring Mobile</a> - So if you want to come work with us and build mobile apps... You know what to do.</li>
</ul>
The best part about all the news over the past year is that the new office is right across the street from my place. :)

<em>P.S. - See how awesome we are:</em>

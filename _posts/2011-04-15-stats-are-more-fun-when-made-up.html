I bought a domain a long time ago with the hopes of creating an application to host some fun and made up stats. For too long I've been using this site as a playground to learn new things. The problem with that is that I'm never actually done. I decided to do something super simple using AppHarbor and nowÂ <a href="http://madeupstats.com">MadeUpStats.com</a> is now finally live and showing some garbage fun statistics. I decided to not over-engineer this site and just get it live. Feel free to leave me a comment for features I should add. If you have a stat you want added, for now, just let me know via Twitter or Facebook and I'll add your bogus stat.

I've decided to start teaching myself RoR as a way to keep my mind fresh, open my mind to new ideas in development and broaden my programming talents. Also, I'm taking two and a half days off this month... About the max I can stand without Internet. Camping in Minnesota from a Thursday to Sunday, should be a good time!

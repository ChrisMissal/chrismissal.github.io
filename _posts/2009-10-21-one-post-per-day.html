I've decided that I'm going to post here at least once per day now. I have my other blogs that I concentrate on, primary <a href="http://www.lostechies.com">LosTechies</a>, but the goal is to keep these short and sweet and share something that I've learned each and every day.

<a href="http://twitter.com/chrismissal">Twitter</a> is a good way to "micro-blog" if you will, but my posts here aren't quite going to make the 140 character cut-off.

For today's topic, if you do anything with a public facing web site, you really need to check out some of the video content that is put out by <a href="http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/">Matt Cutts</a>. Matt works for Google's Spam team (which really means anti-spam) and has excellent topics on how to improve the Page Rank, reputation and relevance of your site.

Wow... I'm moved. The amount of effort that has gone into this (and other missions) will never be understood by 99.99% of the population. This is what keeps me up at night and helps me wake up the morning. It is unfathomable, yet people would rather talk shit about others, watch mindless television and coast through life not understanding the amount of potential we have when we work together. This was great and if you were part of it, you understand. If not, you missed out.

I just typed the following about myself. I thought it was put fairly well:
<blockquote>I consider myself an odd introvert. While I'm uncomfortable meeting new people that are outside my comfort zone, I will sometimes give presentations to 30-50 strangers for over an hour and feel comfortable for the most part. It just has to be my interest or specialty.</blockquote>
I figured it was a good enough partial description of my personality to share. :)

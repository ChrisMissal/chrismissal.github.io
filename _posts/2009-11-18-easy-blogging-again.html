<p>For the last several months, I’ve been blogging without Windows Live Writer. This hasn’t been terrible, but now that I have it again I’m realizing just how much I like it. I can type something up for this site and continue the thought on another blog to which I contribute.</p>  <p>I think this will ramp up my post count across the several blogs I post to. I still don’t think I’m going to be able to hit my mark of 72 technical posts I was aiming for in 2009. I guess if I add up all posts on all sites I probably have it. I guess I can take something away from that. :)</p>

<p><img style="display:inline;margin:0 15px 5px 0;" align="left" src="http://agilezen.com/content/images/app/logo.png" />When I’m working on writing up some new blog posts, I usually have a “TODO” text file that I keep on my desktop (hi-tech, I know). This process has been working quite well for long enough, but since <a href="http://twitter.com/TimBarcz/status/6051366435">we started</a> using <a href="http://agilezen.com">AgileZen</a> at work I’ve begun putting my own tasks and stories into my own project. This helps me keep them all in one place like the text file did, but now I have a way to track how close I am to completing a blog post, a series or readings or whatever it may be. I’m really digging the slick interface and ease of use that is built into the UI. I recommend signing up for a free account like I did if you’re looking to organize your “stuff” better.</p>

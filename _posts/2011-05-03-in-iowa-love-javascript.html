<p>Over the weekend during some <a href="http://iowacodecamp.com">Iowa Code Camp</a> festivities, there was some talk about starting a JavaScript group in the area. With some help from <a href="http://twitter.com/nlsmith">Nathan Smith</a>, we have gotten the ball rolling! Things are still incredibly new right now, but let us know through whatever channel you're comfortable if you have something to ask or suggest.</p>

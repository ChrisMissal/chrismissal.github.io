As of lately, I've been working on a bunch features to add to an ASP.NET MVC site for SEO (Search Engine Optimization). For those that don't know, SEO is improving your ranking in search engines. This helps new people find your web site through the use of a search engine like Google.

Technically, using the MVC stack, there's a lot of nice features we've been taking advantage of, including Routing. This isn't exclusive to ASP.NET MVC, but gives better URL structure to some links that you might need some attention when given keywords.

Aside from the professional details, I'm enjoying some (mostly) nice Iowa weather and looking forward to a wedding and vacation in the next month.

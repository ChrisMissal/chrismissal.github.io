So adding a new member to a software development team slows down the team. It's a law, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooks%27s_law">Brook's Law</a>, to be exact. I have noticed some good trade offs. Our recently hired dev has asked some really good questions about the code. Questions that have gotten me to think differently about how we have designed and/or structured our application. A good fresh set of eyes can be just as helpful as those same eyes that aren't quite up to speed yet.

The more and more I improve myself, whether it's in development or management or other, the more I realize I need to improve myself and my craft.

I have done some speaking gigs around the state this year and I've had to answer some questions to which I didn't know the answer. Now I feel obligated to learn more. Improvement begets the need for improvement, which begets more need for imp... you get the picture.

By no means am I complaining, but I wish the continuous need for improvement also increased the number of hours in the day!

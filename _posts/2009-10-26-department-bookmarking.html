Some time ago, I set up a Delicious page for our department's bookmarks. We might share good usability articles or CSS tips and tricks. Sometimes it's a reference page for NHibernate. We previously sent them around on the distribution list to share with others. It was always a struggle to look back and find a URL that you remember being sent to you.

The Delicious account (that we all share) is great for saving links and tagging them. I'll also subscribe to the feed in my Outlook account, this way I'll get notifications when a new bookmark is added.

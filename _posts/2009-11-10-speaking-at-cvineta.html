Tonight (Nov 10th, 2009) I'll be speaking at the <a href="http://cvineta.org/">Cedar Falls .Net User Group</a> on jQuery. This is an introduction to jQuery and how to get started using it. The aim is to get web developers the visibility of what it is and how to start using it.

If you're in the Cedar Falls and Waterloo area, and you're interested in creating rich, dynamic web sites, stop on by for some free education! <em>I'll do my best, I promise.</em>

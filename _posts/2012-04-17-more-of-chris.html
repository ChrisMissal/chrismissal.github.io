<p>In case you weren't aware, I actually spend more more time blogging in other locations. I recently took a position with <a href="http://headspring.com/blog">Headspring</a> in Austin, TX. Our blogger team has invited me to write some content with them, and <a title="Chris Missal" href="http://www.headspring.com/author/cmissal">I have a few posts</a> already published.</p><p>Additionally, I have started to slow pick up the pace again on <a href="http://lostechies.com">Los Techies</a>. You can find <a title="Chris Missal" href="http://lostechies.com/chrismissal/">my blog</a> there as well.</p>

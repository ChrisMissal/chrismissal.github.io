So much for my post per day huh? I blame <a href="http://iowacodecamp.com">Iowa Code Camp</a>.

I'm presenting "How to do Virtually Anything with jQuery" at Iowa Code Camp in West Des Moines on November 7th. I've been cramming to get as many changes into my presentation as I can before I take off tomorrow morning. I'm thinking I'll have some good stuff ready, but it's always nerve racking when doing a brand new presentation for the first time. Even more since this version of the event has a record number of registrants.

All in all, I think this is going to be a great event with great speakers and topics. I'm really looking forward to it and I know I'm not the only one who is.

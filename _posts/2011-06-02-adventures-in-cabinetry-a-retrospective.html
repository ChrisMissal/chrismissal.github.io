So I don't really work on home projects very often, but when I do, I seem to learn a lot. This time around I've learned a lot about cabinets. Maybe I've only learned about my cabinets, but I'm going to share the things that went well and the things that didn't go well.

<h2>The Plan</h2>
What we were trying to accomplish was the following:
<ol>
	<li>Paint the kitchen walls</li>
	<li>Paint the wooden cabinet doors</li>
	<li>Add new pulls/handles to the doors and drawers</li>
	<li>Add new and matching hinges.</li>
</ol>
<div>We had two days to do this (with one extra day by myself)</div>
<h2>What Went Well</h2>
I had some family and friends helping me and we were able to get the cabinet doors off the cabinets, remove the hinges and remove the pulls. This didn't take long at all with a couple people on the task. This was necessary because we were going to remove the finish so the paint would go on smooth and easy.

Removing the finish took some time, but we used a circular sander with fine grain sandpaper. It wasn't difficult, just time consuming (there were 25 doors to sand). We had to go through two pieces of paper because the first got worn down pretty bad.
<h2>What Didn't Go Well</h2>
When removing the finish on the doors we tried a chemical stripper. This didn't work very well. My cabinet doors are pretty old and either there is a lot of gunk on them or it's just had plenty of time to stick on there.

When you have two doors that open side by side, you want the pulls to be even from the middle and even from the bottom/top. The pulls I had previously were 3 1/4 inches which seems to be a non-standard size. A more common size would be 3 or 4 inches. Since we needed a new size we had to drill new holes. Measuring these is a difficult problem. What we ended up doing was creating a template to try to ensure consistency. This didn't work well, we ended up drilling them and creating two holes that weren't lined up. After several more tries, a template was finally created that worked for all four locations of pulls (top left, top right, bottom left, bottom right). By rotating and flipping the door, you can get it in the correct location to drill. Doing this again, I would make sure to have plenty of wood blocks to line things up and measure, measure, measure...

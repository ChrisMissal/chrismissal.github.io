I just finished up writing an article about <a href="http://www.lostechies.com/blogs/chrismissal/archive/2010/01/28/reading-code-spark-s-once-attribute.aspx">How Spark's Once Attribute Works</a>. This was a lot better of an exercise than I had hoped. I've heard of two good practices that this successfully accomplished:
<ol>
	<li>Reading code to help you be a better developer</li>
	<li>Teaching somebody to help yourself learn it better</li>
</ol>
It wasn't exactly easy trying to explain some code that I, myself, didn't know very well. I had to read through and re-read to fully understand how the code works. It was a great exercise, I'll do this more often and highly recommend it to others as well!

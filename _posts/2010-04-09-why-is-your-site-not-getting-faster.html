Your site's performance should always be improving. Period. Hardware and internet connections are continually getting better and faster, so why are some web sites not getting faster?

I think it's because people aren't too concerned with their site's speed, but they should be! Maybe they're writing bad code on top of existing code and slowly ruining their project... I've seen it happen before.

Am I just crazy or do people not measure and/or care about performance?

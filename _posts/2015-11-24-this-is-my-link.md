So we were talking about links in email that are not supposed to be forwarded. Things like password reset, unsubscribe, etc. Anyway, the Rifleman's Creed came up so I thought I'd modify it a bit:

> This is my link. There are many like it, but this one is mine.

> My link is my best friend. It is my life. I must master it as I must master my life.

> My link, without me, is useless. Without my link, I am useless. I must click my link true. I must click straighter than the criminal who is trying to hack me. I must click him before he click me. I will...

> My link and I know that what counts in web is not the pages we visit, the noise of our videos, nor the money we waste. We know that it is the views that count. We will click...

> My link is human, even as I, because it is my life. Thus, I will learn it as a brother. I will learn its weaknesses, its strength, its parts, its accessories, its domains and its path. I will keep my link clean and ready, even as I am clean and ready. We will become part of each other. We will...

> Before web, I swear this creed. My link and I are the defenders of my Internet. We are the masters of our bandwidth. We are the saviors of my life.

> So be it, until victory is humanity's and there is no enemy, but peace!

I think it's better this way. For reference: [Rifleman's Creed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rifleman%27s_Creed)

This is so stupid.

I'm off to the University of Minnesota to attend the <a href="http://twincitiescodecamp.com">Twin Cities Code Camp</a>! I'm really looking forward to sessions on JavaScript, Ruby, MVC, DDD and learning more about Pex.

I don't think I'll be able to attend all the sessions I'd like to, but not being able to attend all I want is a better problem than not having enough good ones to choose from. I haven't been to a TCCC yet. I'm confident that it will live up to the expectations.

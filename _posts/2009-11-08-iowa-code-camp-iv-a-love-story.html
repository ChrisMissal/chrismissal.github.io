The 4th Iowa Code Camp is now over and my heart is broken. I wish we could do these every weekend, I had an amazing time! Also, like most code camps and conferences, it was another good opportunity to put some faces on Twitter handles and meet new people.

I had a really good turnout for my jQuery presentation (I say that because we ran out of chairs in the room), but I have a lot of improvements to make. If anybody that attended my session has any feedback they couldn't fit on the evaluation form, please feel free to leave them in the comments.

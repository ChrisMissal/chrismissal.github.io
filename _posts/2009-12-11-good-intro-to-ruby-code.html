I came across another good resource for learning Ruby. On Twitter, <a href="http://twitter.com/lazycoder">@lazycoder</a> retweeted a link from <a href="http://twitter.com/sintaxi">@sintaxi</a> that mentioned a new github repository for learning Ruby syntax and code. You can find it here: <a href="http://github.com/sintaxi/learn-ruby">http://github.com/sintaxi/learn-ruby</a>.

I recently received a license to the copy of RubyMine from JetBrains that I won. I haven't used it much, but it seems to be a really good Ruby editor. The best part is pointing it to a git repository and opening it up with almost zero setup and no command line.

## The Blog Move and Recent Changes

I began to make some big changes to the site recently. The biggest is that this is no longer hosted on Wordpress. I have moved to GitHub Pages with Jekyll. They come for various reasons, but here are a few that I'd like to share:

1. I wanted to learn something new. This is built on Jekyll + GitHub pages. Also, I really like what I'm seeing with [Prose.io](http://prose.io) so far.
1. Creating blog posts with [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) appeals to me very much.
1. It's been awhile since I've been able to handcraft a little HTML/CSS. I plan to use this as a playground for some ideas that I have.
1. The savings of $1 per month will be great!

There's still a lot more to be done (missing images, broken links, no comments, etc).

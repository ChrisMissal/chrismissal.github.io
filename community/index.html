Usually three times per month, emails are sent out keeping the members up to date with reminders and notices on upcoming meetings and any information from previous meetings in follow-up messages.</p>

			</p>IowaJS started as a topic at the Spring 2011 Iowa Code Camp and a couple weeks later had the first meeting. The organization is still very young, but we're getting lots of people to show up that are very interested in JavaScript. Our meetings are more like meetups than presentations, everything is very informal by design.</p>

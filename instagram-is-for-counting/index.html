<section>
	<p>I have an Instagram account, but I only use it for counting.</p>
	<p>There are only a few &quot;rules&quot; that I'm doing my best to follow:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Photo contains integers, no skips, no duplicates</li>
		<li>Don't take photos of the same thing twice. No duplicates on things like playing cards or pool balls.</li>
		<li>Any language counts! (Arabic numerals, roman numerals, English text, Spanish text, etc)</li>
	</ol>
	<p>That's about it! Here's what I have so far:</p>
</section>

<div id="instafeed"></div>

<script type="text/javascript">
    var userFeed = new Instafeed({
        get: 'user',
        userId: 365726455,
        accessToken: '365726455.467ede5.d5bed85b653d4bc1ae1276001c2060fb'
    });
    userFeed.run();
</script>

	<p class="lead">I have an Instagram account, but I only use it for counting.</p>
	<p>There are a few simple &quot;rules&quot; that I'm doing my best to follow:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Photo contains integers, no skips, no duplicates</li>
		<li>Don't take photos of the same thing twice. No duplicates on things like playing cards or pool balls.</li>
		<li>Any language counts! (Arabic numerals, roman numerals, English text, Spanish text, etc)</li>
	</ol>
	<p>That's about it! Here's what I have so far:</p>

title: Our Favorite Speakers
---

The other day I asked on Twitter who were some of the favorite speakers at software conference:
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>Your favorite speakers at software conferences... Go!! Also, I&#39;ll take a RT if you&#39;re willing.</p>&mdash; Chris Missal (@ChrisMissal) <a href="https://twitter.com/ChrisMissal/statuses/358260054840983552">July 19, 2013</a></blockquote>

And got some really great feedback. I thought I'd share the top responses and hopefully get some more recommendations in the comments.
Let me know who is missing from the list!

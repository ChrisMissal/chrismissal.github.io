<img class="alignright" style="margin-left:5px;margin-right:5px;" title="Chris Missal" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3c4478e6ae6c60b73d21c9fa0d1785ea?s=128&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=PG" alt="" width="128" height="128" />My name is Chris Missal, currently I'm a software developer in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. I have a passion for creating software that <strong>works well</strong>. I have a very strong opinion that testing software is the most important piece of delivering quality projects, and delivering them on time. Not only does it provide the peace of mind that the application does what it is supposed to do, but provides faster turnaround times when adding new features and functionality.

<h2>My Background</h2>
<div class="background">

Most of my background is in web development using ASP.NET with C#. I have developed several web sites in PHP and related technologies, although lately, I've been focusing more towards .Net and its Open Source frameworks and libraries. Major strengths of mine include XHTML, CSS &amp; the jQuery JavaScript library.  I do my best work in web development, but have some experience in desktop applications and Windows services. I have started learning Ruby more recently and can write Ruby, but haven't put it towards any large projects yet.

<h2>Non-Professional / Miscellaneous</h2>
<div class="miscellaneous">

Some other things about me that I'd like to share is that I'm a <em>newly</em> avid disc golfer. I picked it up semi-seriously at the beginning of summer in 2008 and have been playing quite a bit since then. Additionally, I'm a big fan of movies. I like to watch them, collect them and pick them apart.

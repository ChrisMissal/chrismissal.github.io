<div id="post">
For the first time since I've been attending, and maybe since <a href="http://crineta.org">CRineta</a> existed, we had two meetings tonight. The first was <a href="http://devlicio.us/blogs/tim_barcz/default.aspx">Tim Barcz</a> presenting on <em>Building and Testing Loosely Coupled Applications with Rhino Mocks</em> and <a href="http://www.lostechies.com/blogs/dahlbyk/default.aspx">Keith Dahlby</a> with an <em>Introduction to .Net and Q &amp; A.</em>

I attended the Introduction to .Net, not because I needed to learn it, but I thought it would be a discussion about using and developing applications in .Net and thought I could provide some of my experiences since it is primarily what I do. The discussion was great and there was a good turnout. I think people got a lot more out of it than I expected. (Not that I didn't think Keith would do a good job, but because the questions were excellent and a lot of people were taking notes). I'm hoping we can do more of these dual track sessions in the future!

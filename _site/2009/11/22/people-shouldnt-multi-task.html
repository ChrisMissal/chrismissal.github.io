I would consider the title of this post a true statement. Yes, people <strong>can</strong> multi-task, but they probably lower the quality of those tasks being performed (think driving while texting).

The other day, however, I was a multi-tasking maniac! Normally I like to work on something relatively undisturbed, but this day I was hopping between tasks and conversations like a mad man. It was very rare, but I actually got a lot of stuff accomplished. Since these days are rare, I'm going to chalk that day up to the one time in the next 100 days that it will happen. I'll go back to my single threaded work habits from now on.

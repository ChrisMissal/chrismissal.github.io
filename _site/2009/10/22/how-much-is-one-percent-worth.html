Today at work we were talking about how tiny improvements in e-commerce can yield big results. Take the following example:
<blockquote>You sell widgets on your web site and through email campaigns your average order is $50. Your email list is 50,000 subscribers strong; you can send them marketing emails to them all to entice them to purchase. At a 1% conversion rate you'll get 5 more orders for every percent you can decrease your bounce rate.</blockquote>
Obviously the key here is having a large list, but in our example above one percent will increase our revenue by $250, not bad!

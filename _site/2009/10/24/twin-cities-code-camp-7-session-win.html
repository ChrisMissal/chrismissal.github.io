<div id="_mcePaste" style="position:absolute;left:-10000px;top:0;width:1px;height:1px;">I was really looking forward to the first session of the day at Twin Cities Code Camp. It was [@kevingisi|Keven Gisi] talking about JavaScript testing. There was a problem right away though, the University of Minnesota's Wifi was down. I don't blame Kevin for putting his stuff online. It's the internet, it's always there, right?</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position:absolute;left:-10000px;top:0;width:1px;height:1px;">With some coordination with the attendees, Kevin was able to present on somebody else's laptop, with a tethered mobile phone. Great teamwork!</div>

With some coordination with the attendees, Kevin was able to present on somebody else's laptop, with a tethered mobile phone. Great teamwork!

The talk was really good and I have a lot of work to do for my future JS coding.

As a geek and a software developer, I spend a lot of time in front of a computer and there are things I do that I take for granted. I'd like to compile a list of things that speed things up, make things easier, or are just helpful. We can all share this list with our friends and family members that might not know them. Here's a few that pop into my mind right away:
<ul>
	<li>When entering a username and password, you should be able to just press 'Enter' after you type your password. There's no need to go back to the mouse, move it to the button and click it. Once you get used to this, you'll use it all the time. When you run into  a page that has you enter information that doesn't "go" when Enter is pressed, you'll start to get annoyed. <em>(2009-10-18)</em></li>
	<li>If you are browsing the web in a browser that isn't very old, you should be able to just type a search in the address bar at the top. This will save you the loading of <span style="text-decoration:line-through;">Google</span> your favorite search engine. Some browsers still might have the search bar attached near the address bar, but these seem to be going away with newer versions. <em>(2009-10-18)</em></li>
	<li>Google searches that appear inside a lightly shaded box, or in a sidebar are listed as "Sponsored links". These are paid for by individuals or companies to promote their link to the top. The page that it takes you to might not be the most relevant, it's just the one that won the bidding war. <em>(2009-10-18)</em></li>
</ul>
Leave a comment with your own tips and I'll add it to the list!
